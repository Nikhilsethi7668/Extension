# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create simple icons using any image editor or online icon generator.
For now, the manifest references these files to avoid console errors.

To fix the missing icon warnings:
1. Create or download icon images in the required sizes
2. Save them in this directory with the exact names above
3. Reload the extension

Temporary workaround: The extension will work without icons, but you'll see console warnings.
